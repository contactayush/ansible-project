## Ansible Structure


installation.yaml: Installs all required software on the Ansible hosts.
main.yaml: Defines the process for creating a WAR file and starting the Tomcat server.

inventory/: Directory containing Ansible inventory files.
Installation.yaml
The installation.yaml playbook is responsible for installing all the required software on the Ansible hosts. It includes pre-installation tasks, software installation, and necessary configurations.

Example content:

---
- name: Install Required Software
  hosts: ansible_hosts
  roles:
    - common
Main.yaml
The main.yaml playbook defines the process for creating a WAR file and starting the Tomcat server. It leverages the roles defined in the roles/ directory.

Example content:

---
- name: Deploy Application
  hosts: ansible_hosts
  tasks:
    - name: Create WAR File
         Your tasks for creating the WAR file go here

    - name: Start Tomcat Server
         Your tasks for starting the Tomcat server go here
Usage
Edit the inventory/ansible_hosts file to include the IP addresses or hostnames of your Ansible hosts.

Run the installation.yaml playbook:

ansible-playbook  ansible/installation.yaml

Run the main.yaml playbook:
ansible-playbook - ansible/main.yaml
